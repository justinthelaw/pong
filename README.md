# Pong

This game development exercise was adapted form HarvardX's CS50g. Some of the base game elements were taken from Matthias Richter's original pong game. Addition of the collision physics, ball and block elements, "AI", and actual user interfaces were developed by me.

## Pong "AI"

The goal of this project is to create an "AI" for one of the players in this homebrew version of pong. This version of pong was reviewed as a class during the lecture.

## Running Pong

To run this game in Windows, drag the pong directory on to your LOVE2D executable (e.g. `love.exe`). To run this game in Linux or MacOS, run `love .` while in the pong directory where `main.lua` exists.
